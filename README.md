# VR-FinalProject
Using Tilt Brush to Style your Character 
<br /> Shreenija Vadayar 

## Project Description
For this final project, I am envisioning a game/interaction where users can choose different fabrics with different colors and textures to paint the clothes on the mannequin. In other words, I want users to be able to dress a character according to their style preferences. I want to create an environment that mimics a designer’s studio with a male and a female mannequin that users can choose from to dress. For choosing fabrics, I think I am going to have squares that display the available fabrics (like a fabric swatch). Then, when users choose a fabric, they will be able to preview it on a sphere before finalizing their choice. There are probably some aspects that I’ll need to change, add, and/or remove as I work, but this is what I am thinking of right now.  

## Feature Breakdown
1. Tilt Brush: A brush to draw and paint things in an open space  
    1. Estimated Challenge - 5: I have never worked with Tilt Brush before, so I’m sure it will be a little bit of a challenge. There are a lot of tutorials, so I’m sure I’ll be able to get started pretty easily, but I might have a hard time figuring out how to paint on a stationary object like a mannequin. 

2. Displaying Different Squares of Fabric: I want to display different options of fabrics for users to choose from when they are styling their mannequin. 
    1. Estimated Challenge – 3: I know how to add textures and materials to different 3D objects, but I think figuring out a display and selection system that optimizes the process is what is going to pose a challenge for me. 

3. Trialing Materials on a Sphere: I want users to be able to preview their material on a sphere before making their final selection.  
    1. Estimated Challenge – 5: I haven’t ever done anything like this, so I’m sure I’ll struggle a little and possibly need some guidance. I’ll just have to start working and go from there.  

4. Using Chosen Material with Tilt Brush: I want the users to be able to use the fabric they chose to draw on their mannequin with tilt brush.  
    1. Estimated Challenge – 4: I’m sure this will be a part of learning how to use tilt brush, but I am a little worried about implementing this.  

5. Figuring out How to Reset Scene: Once one user is done styling their mannequin, I need to figure out a way to reset the scene for the next user.  
    1. Estimated Challenge – 3: I’m sure it won’t be too complicated, but I don’t have experience resetting a scene. I only have experience moving from one scene to another, and then building and running the program again to reset everything for the next user.  

6. Undo or Erase a Move: I want users to be able to undo or erase a section of their work should they need to. 
    1. Estimated Challenge – 5: I have never done this in a game in VR either, so this will be new territory for me as well. I’m sure there are some tutorials out there that I can start with, before customizing it to my own needs.


## Milestones
This is what I am thinking of getting done for the two milestones that we have due before the final deliverable is due. 

1. By 11/19 - I want to build a basic environment for my game that mimics a designer’s studio and has both the male and female mannequins (assets). I also want to be able to implement Tilt Brush so I can draw in a 3D space. The goal is not to have Tilt Brush fully functional in terms of my game, but rather just a generally functioning implementation of Tilt Brush. I also want to figure out how to display and have users try different fabrics to use on their mannequins that they’re styling.  

2. By 12/5 - By this milestone, I would like to have some other things implemented and built on top of the previous milestone. I would like to have the Tilt Brush implemented specially for the needs and wants of my game. I would also like to have undoing and erasing moves figured out by this milestone as well. I think it’ll go hand in hand with the Tilt Brush implementation, but I’ll have to wait and see.


## Inspirations
1. After your suggestion to look into Tilt Brush for my final project, I did some research and came across the article below. This is what inspired me to use Tilt Brush to “design” clothes. I’ve simplified the scope down a lot for the time and resources we have before the final deliverable is due. So, I will just have mannequins with some basic dress forms that the users and style how they deem fitting.

2. This was one of the example videos I found where someone was using Tilt Brush to design clothing onto a mannequin. This made me wonder whether or not I actually need a dress form on the mannequins or if I should just let user free hand it and draw whatever they’d like on the mannequins.
